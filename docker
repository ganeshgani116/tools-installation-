#What is Docker ?
(Docker is a containerization platform that provides easy way to containerize your applications, which means, using Docker you can build container images,
run the images to create containers and also push these containers to container regestries such as DockerHub, Quay.io and so on.)


#Docker LifeCycle
We can use the above Image as reference to understand the lifecycle of Docker.

There are three important things,

1.docker build -> builds docker images from Dockerfile
2.docker run -> runs container  from docker images
3.docker push -> push the container image to public/private regestries to share the docker images.



#INSTALL DOCKER
A very detailed instructions to install Docker are provide in the below link

https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

For Demo,

You can create an Ubuntu EC2 Instance on AWS and run the below commands to install docker.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io -y 
sudo systemctl status docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
 #BUILD IAMAGE COMMAND 
docker build -t -image:latest .


#IF YOU WANT PULL IMAGE FROM DOCKER REPOSITORY

docker run <iamge name>  (if you create image through "run" it autometically container creted it self)

docker pull <iamge name>  (pull is created only image only)


#HOW TO DOCKER IMAGES  
docker images

#HOW TO CHECK DOCKER CONTAINER
docker ps (it showing running conatiner )
docker ps -a )it showing total containers)

#HOW TO CHECK IMAGE WITH IMAGE VERSION ,ALL THINGS 
docker search <image>

#IF YOU WANT CREATE CONTSINER THROUGH IMAGE 
docker run -it <image name>
docker run -dt <image name>
